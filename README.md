Update of Jaxxas mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=722086956

- Removed the Core-requirement and included it in the mod instead since this mod seemed to be the only one that used it.
- You can now create Helixien Geysers if https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877699803]Vanilla Helixien Gas Expanded is loaded

Version: 2.1.0.0
Links to all my mods including non steam versions available at: https://github.com/jaxxa/JaxxaRimworldReleaseCollection/blob/master/README.md

As of 1.1 this now required EnhancedDevelopment Core to be installed.

Adds a Drilling Laser Targeting system that allows the creation or removal of steam vents. After research and construction, you will power the building while it conducts a subsurface scan. After the scan is complete, it can use a large amount of stored battery power to activate the laser of an orbiting satellite to drill or collapse a steam vent.
