  <!-- EN: Conducts a detailed subsurface scan to allow the precise direction of orbiting laser systems to create or destroy a steam geyser. After the scan is complete, it can use a large amount of stored battery power to activate the laser of an orbiting satellite to drill or collapse a steam vent. Warning, the intense heat from the weapon system has been known to start fires. -->
